<h1>David's Past,Present,and Future</h1>


<h2>My past</h2>

<p>I was born on Dominican Republic,Santo Domingo, i was born at 12:00 am, and after that well i don't remember any of what happened on my first and second years, i remember a little bit about my third birthday, Ever since i was born i lived on one house-for 11 years-, which is placed on the capital and in a street called the Quiskeya, i lived close to the grocery store, my uncles house, and the church. So after living there for 11 years we moved to another house, lived in that house for at least 2 or 1/2 years and then moved to the united states, After many months we finally got a house for us, and that's pretty much it, That's my past.</p><p>Look at this website, it has resorts hotels,most of the resorts are located close to the beach, same with the hotels, but i prefer resorts, going to a resort in dominican republic is like going to heaven, but expensive indeed but trust me it's definetely worth it, i had a very good time when i went to one of those.</p>

<p>I'm here on jl mann, doing the work i'm supposed to do, and drawing is one of my favorite things to do, My interest is to progress as a student and graduate, but i don't really have a career on mind, closest thing to come is to be a doctor, but that's not 100% confirmed, i just hope i can find something i can do in the future, but it's too early too think about that, that might distract me.And here is an special hyperlink just for you!check it out if you're interested (which i doubt). <a href="https://www.lifeishard.ro/">DO NOT TOUCH</a>.</p>

<h2> My Future!</h2>

<p>I have plans to Travel back to my homeland which is Dominican Republic, of course, i can't tell when will that happen because i'll probably be at collegue, but who knows, anything can happen on a short period of time same thing for a long period of time, but anyway i don't plan on having a family while i'm on college, i plan to have a family after college, one thing is for sure, i'll be busy if i become a doctor, but the payment in here is nice, I'll probably work while i'm on college, after all i'll be an adult, so i and my parents would expect a lot more of things from me than they do now.Not sure if i'll be in either clemson or furman, for now just look at this <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson university.</a></p>

<h3>Things that i want to do in the future</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I would like to order dominos online, that'll be satisfying <a href="https://www.dominos.com/en/">Dominos Pizza</a>.</li>
  <li>Have 3 kids.</li>
  <li>Graduate.</li>
  <li>Make myself and my parents proud.</li>
  <li>Visit Dominican Republic.</li>
